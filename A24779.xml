            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div type="introduction">
               <head>To the READER.</head>
               <p>THE Occaſion of Publiſhing this, is to Satisfie the World of the Indefatigable Induſtry of the Jeſuites, in carrying on their wicked Deſign; and that this Attempt upon the Perſon of Mr. <hi>De Luzancy</hi> is ſufficient to Convince the whole World, that they will not onely ſtick to take away the Fame, but the Lives of Princes, to promote their Bloody Religion. As for the latter, Hiſtories have Examples enough; and for the former, the firſt of the ſix enſuing Heads of St. <hi>Germin's</hi> wicked atteſtations (though moſt abominably falſe and Treaſonable) is a ſufficient Proof, there being no Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Prince that hath done more for the ſecurity and ſatisfaction of his Subjects than his moſt Gracious Majeſty, whom God long preſerve from all the Plots and Conſpiracies of the St. <hi>Germins</hi> and <hi>Colemans,</hi> which laſt was recommended to the Correſpondence of Mr. <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> by the ſaid St. <hi>Germin;</hi> for the Apprehending of whom upon this horrid Account, a Proclamation was Iſſued out by His Majeſty, bearing date <hi>Novemb.</hi> 10th. 1675.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THE Fourth of <hi>October,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Jeſuite, by Name St. <hi>Germin,</hi> in Company with another Man, whom by his Language I perceived to be a <hi>French-man,</hi> and whom I have underſtood ſince to be alſo a Jeſuite, came into my Chamber as it began to grow dark: They began very Civily with me; ſo having deſired them to take Seats, and ſent for Light, the ſaid St. <hi>Germin</hi> asked of me, whether he might ſpeak freely in my Chamber, without danger of being over-heard. I Anſwered, yes; and that there was no body above, nor below to hear them. Then the ſaid St. <hi>Germin</hi> was pleaſed to beſtow on me many Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious words, calling me <hi>Hugonot, Renegado,</hi> and Man without Faith, that had brought a Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Scandal upon the Church, who was bound in Duty to expiate ſo great a Crime, to go back for <hi>France,</hi> and ſpend there the reſt of my days in a Monaſtery. As I was about to Reply, his Companion, ſpeaking <hi>French,</hi> ſaid, there was no need of ſo much Reaſoning, it being an eaſie matter to ſtab or convey me away; and that they were ready to do it, ſhould I ſpeak one word more; and that they had three more fit for that purpoſe, in caſe I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do as they would have me: So continuing their threatnings, they made me promiſe them that I would depart from <hi>England,</hi> and go over in a Yatch His Majeſty had granted to a Catholick Lord, who was going to <hi>France,</hi> or in a Ship was going for <hi>Rochel:</hi> They enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves at the ſame time to write to the Rector of the Jeſuites there in my behalf, and bidding me not to trouble my ſelf any further, for they would furniſh me with Bills of Exchange to the value of 400 <hi>l. ſterling,</hi> and more, if need required, the Perſon they were employed by ſparing no money for ſo good a Uſe: the ſaid St. <hi>Germin</hi> added, to make ſure of you, we think it neceſſary you ſhould Copy over, and ſet your Hand to this writing; ſo giving me the Paper, I took it, deſiring firſt leave to read it: I found it contained a Recantation in terms abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable of all I had ſpoken in general, and in particular againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was full of Horrid Slanders and Calumnies againſt all the Proteſtants, their Biſhops and Miniſters, with a thouſand Impieties, not fit to ſet down here. I therefore riſing off my Seat, I refuſed both to Copy and ſet my Hand to their Paper, at which St. <hi>Germin</hi> riſeth up in Anger, and runs to the Door to call the Men that were ready to convey me away, or ſtab me. I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted out of my wits and all my ſenſes; then all in a Trance I took the Paper, and Copied it over, and put my Hand to it, having as well as I could in the Condition I was, firſt put out, and changed ſeveral things that were againſt Biſhops and Miniſters: The two Jeſuites ſatisfied with this, took their leave of me, threatning, that if I ſhould ſpeak one word of what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they would have my Soul out of my Body, which would be always an eaſie thing for them to do, ſince they had of their People every where Men of Execution, and were Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to kill me, in caſe I would not depart when they ſhould think fit, as my Promiſe was. Theſe Gentlemen having left me, I came to my ſelf, and began to conſider what I had done; I concluded my fault was great, and after many Reflections I judged the beſt way was, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly to get my Writing out of their Hands; I have ſince tryed it ſeveral times, diſſembling for this purpoſe with the ſaid St. <hi>Germin,</hi> and telling him that I would ſee it onely to add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it that was more material for the Satisfaction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and changing ſome other things leſs to their purpoſe, but in truth, to tear it in pieces, if I could have it, but all in vain: So ſeeing they would not do it, I have thought my ſelf bound in Conſcience
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95593:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>to Repair in ſome meaſure this my fault, and the Scandal that may fall on the Church openly to complain of ſo bold an Attempt, without few or no Preſidents in this Kingdom; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Kings Power and Authority againſt this bold Jeſuite, that I may live in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries without always being afraid of my Life: And further, I do conceive my ſelf Obliged in Duty to Declare, that I am not onely ready to make Oath of all that is above written, but that this alſo is what the ſaid St. <hi>Germin,</hi> conferring with me, hath Atteſted to me.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the King was a Catholick in his Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the Court was Endeavouring to get a Liberty of Conſcience in <hi>England</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and that Granted, that in two Years moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Pope.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That he knew the Kings Intention concerning Religion, and that he was ſure he would Approve of all he ſhould do in that Matter.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That Laughed at the Parliament, it being a word onely that had but a little time, and no better welcome to the Court than me, he having great Intrigues with all the Nobility.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That it was good ſometimes to force People to Swear, and that during 14 Moneths he had Perſecuted a Man here in <hi>London,</hi> whom he had at laſt got again to his Party, and Obliged to make a Publick Recantation of the Proteſtant Faith before 200 Perſons more.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. That there was an infinite Number of Prieſts and Jeſuites hidden in <hi>London,</hi> that did God very good Service.</p>
               <p>All theſe things will be Sworn to by Mr. <hi>De Luzancy,</hi> to have been Affirmed by the Jeſuite St. <hi>Germin,</hi> who is the buſieſt Fellow among them againſt the Proteſtants, and many Perſons of good Repute and Credit are ready to Juſtifie upon their Oaths, that ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks have ſpoken things quite as bad, if not worſe.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuites finding that Mr. <hi>De Luzancy,</hi> inſtead of fulfilling his Promiſe they had extorted from him, had Preached on Sunday the 31th. of <hi>October,</hi> againſt the Pope, and had ſpoke ſomething of the Proceeding towards him, a Letter was ſent to him on the Second of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to his Chamber, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You are a Miſerable Wretch left by God, that Preached on Sunday laſt as many Hereſies as words; this is like a Renegado, an Apoſtate, and an Abominable Hugonot, Remnant of a Cloyſter, without Honour, without Conſcience; who having loſt himſelf in <hi>France</hi> with a thouſand Debaucheries, and committed there ſeveral Thefts and Roberies, is come hither to Renounce Chriſtianiſm and Papiſtry for a piece of Bread; were you not amongſt People as bad as your ſelf, you had been already Burnt alive after the Blaſphemies you have committed againſt God, the Pope, and the Jeſuites: Do you think we do not know you, and that we have not means to ſeize on you? If you dare remain a Fortnight longer in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> you ſhall have marks thereof, that will make you Repent all the days of your Life, your not doing what we would have you do ſome weeks ago. Have a care of your ſelf, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Renegado.</q>
